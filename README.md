# deepcopiesJs
this repo is for examples of how to make deep copies in javascript.

It shows different methods and examples for shallow and deep copies in javascript.

all code is in index.js

use 'npm i' to install lodash.

then 'node index.js' to play through the script.

use break points to watch the shallow copy's value change when properties of the reference object are changed.
